        <p> Hello! I’m ANKITHA, a passionate Computer Science student with a deep interest in technology, problem-solving, and coding. Currently pursuing my degree at Jyothy Institute of Technology, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a range of projects that blend theory with real-world applications. My focus areas include web development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and I love exploring new technologies and challenges that push my boundaries.

            I am always eager to learn and grow, whether it’s through academic projects, personal coding challenges, or internships. My goal is to combine my technical skills with creativity to develop innovative solutions and make a meaningful impact in the tech world.
            
            Feel free to browse through my portfolio to see the projects I’ve worked on. Let’s connect and collaborate!</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My hobbies include:</p>
    <ul>
        Dancing: Dance teaches me the importance of consistency, attention to detail, and team coordination. Just like in programming, each movement or step requires practice, precision, and a clear understanding of the bigger picture.

Singing: As an singer, I’ve learned the power of clear communication and performance. Singing with a group has strengthened my collaborative skills, which are essential when working with cross-functional teams on software development projects.
